# Python Advance
The Python Advanced will teach you to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem-solving skills), work with stacks and queues (Stacks & Queues), tuples and sets (Tuples & Sets), matrices (Multidimensional Lists), as well as files and directories. Attention will be paid to the functional programming paradigm. It will take a deeper look at recursive functions and functions with multiple arguments. 
# Acquired skills
- Working with two-dimensional data structures
- Creating linear data structures
- Application of basic algorithms
- Application of functional programming
- Work with data streams, files and directories
- Error handling
# Python OOP
The Python OOP course will teach you the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), work with classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling, and build class hierarchies. The basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. We will go into the most commonly used design patterns. We will get acquainted with the SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. We will learn what iterators and generators are and how to use them. We will learn how to create and use decorators. We will pay attention to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
# Acquired skills
- Understanding the object-oriented programming paradigm
- Applying the principles of object-oriented programming
- Creating a hierarchy of classes and inheritance
- Component testing (unit testing)
- Working with iterators and generators
- Working with decorators
